This is an experimental Javascript utility to comsposite skin layers for MakeHuman models.

[Live demo is here](http://vestan.github.io/)

All skin images are made by and belong to the MakeHuman project, all credit should go to them.  Bug reports, comments and complaints should be made here, and not with the MakeHuman project.

If you would like to contibute masks, please do :-)

## Roadmap / TODO

* Tidy the UI
* Add more masks
* Add a WebGL View with Three.js
* Add a feature to generate complimentary specular maps
* Add a coloring tool to paint faces on the default UV from 3d view

## To research

* Alternate way to paint very closely spaced faces, such as eyelids
* Baking textures in Javascript
* Using Javascript to produce a blend file with shaders and assets for makeup / tattoo layers
